# 2D Raytracing Example

This project is written in Python. To run this project please make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python") installed on your machine.

This is a Python program written using Pygame that uses the mathmatical concept of [line-line intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection "line-line intersection") to cast rays from a point and determine when they hit an object. [Raytracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics) "Raytracing") is traditionally used for 3D applications, but I figured that I would make this 2D example because it was fun.
